# CQRS.IO

This is a node.js cqrs a la greg young, this is a strait port of the [simple cqrs](https://github.com/gregoryyoung/m-r) example that greg added to his github repo.

This framework is the simplest pieces for beginning an implemention of CQRS in node.

At the moment this is it infancy with just the skeleton of the framework in place however I am looking to expand it by adding the following features:

    * Snapshots.
    * Redis for publishing events.
    * Adding support for multiple event and snapshot stores.
    * Expand the denormalisers and their stores.
    * Create a real-world example archtecture for proof of concept. (most important)
    
In general there is not a lot to do.

Happy coding!
